Computer Security Notes 



Information security or InfoSec is the practice protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, destruction, or modification. 




Secrecy, or confidentiality, means that only authorized people should be able to access or read specific computer systems and data

Integrity means that only authorized people should have the ability to use or modify systems and data. 

And availability means that authorized people always have access to their systems and data. 

Start with who your enemy is: threat model
	• Prepares who your threat is 

No one should reveal there password to attacker.


Authentication by which computer stands who are they interacting with. 

3 Types of authentication: 
1.) What you know 
2.) What you have 
3.) what you are

Biotremeic is known for probability 


	• This is known as two-factor or multi-factor authentication. An attacker may be able to guess your password or steal your phone: but it much harder, but its much harder to do both. 
This is done through Permissions or Access Control Lists (ACL), which describe what access each user has for every file, folder and program on a computer. 


Read - allows a user to see the contents of a file. 

Write - allows a user to modify the content

Execute - Allows a user to run a file

Three Level of Access: 
	• Public:
	• Secret: 
	• Top Secret: 


The first general rule of thum is people shouldn’t be able to read up 

If a user is only cleared to read secret files they shouldn’t be able to read top secret files but should be able to access secret and public ones


The second general rule of thumb is that people shouldn’t be able to write down: they shouldn’t be able to modify the public secret files.

Remember the less code the better

Independent verification and validation: this works by having a code audited by crowd of security minded developers. 


To achieve isolation: we can sandbox a application, for example its like placing an angry kid in a sandbox when the kid goes ballistic they only destroy the sandcastle in their own box, but other kids in the playground continue to having fun. Operating systems attempt to sandbox applications by giving each their own block of memory that others programs can't touch.
